# IDE Setup

If using WebStorm, the following customizations are required:

1. .gitignore: Exclude .idea
1. Settings > Directories: Exclude .idea and .meteor
1. Settings > Editor > Editor Tabs: Enable "Mark modified tabs with asterisk"
1. Settings > General: Disable "Save files on frame deactivation" and 
    "Save files automatically"

If using SublimeText or TextMate, no such customizations are required.
